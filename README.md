# Market VWAP and POC Analysis

This notebook is a companion to an article I published on LinkedIn, where I explore how trading volume shapes market structure.  
The focus is on two key price levels commonly used in market analysis:

- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**: an average price weighted by volume, often seen as a fair value line by institutional traders.
- **POC (Point of Control)**: the price level where the highest volume occurred, showing where most transactions concentrated.

Using data from Yahoo Finance, I analyze both the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 over the past 3 months, calculating these levels and visualizing them together with daily price and volume.

The charts highlight key zones where market participants showed strong interest, offering insights into support/resistance and market balance.

For a deeper explanation and interpretation of the results, please refer to the full article on LinkedIn:
